Welcome to the playground of my game making hobby. I love to dive into the creative aspects of game design and constantly chip away 
at this project over time.

### 2D Game Engine Core			     	      	
* Designed a flexible game and physics engine framework 
* Developed a scalable save/load system for complex engines by integrating JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) using list and map data structures to    save and load application states. 

### Real-Time Turn-based Battle Database & System Handling
* Designed multiple system prototypes suited for frequent requirement changes by breaking code into individual modular components. Progressive implementation reduced memory usage by 15%.

### UX/UI Design
* Designed the front-end code user interface. Incorporated original asset development through Aseprite and FL Studio 20.

### Automation Testing/Quality Assurance
* Implemented testing plans to accelerate software development and prioritise traceability.
* Wrote custom automation scripts that maintain operational continuity, leading to 50% shorter test times.
